This is the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe is located above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe in each hemisphere.
The parietal lobe is partially responsible for sensory information like eye-to-hand coordination, spatial awareness and navigation.

The front part of the parietal lobe processes sensory information while the rear part is specialized in integrating sensory sensations
from the various sensory systems, mainly from the sense of touch and sight, but also to a lesser extent from other senses.
