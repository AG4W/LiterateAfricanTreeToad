  description: "\u2022    Largest of the four major lobes.\r\n\u2022    Located in
    the front of each hemisphere\r\n\u2022    Separated by a groove between tissues
    called sulcus.\r\n\u2022    Can be further divided into the frontal cortex which
    includes the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex.\r\n\u2022    The front
    of the frontal lobe is called the prefrontal cortex.\r\n\u2022    Function: the
    frontal cortex can be considered the \u201Caction cortex\u201D and is responsible
    for action of one kind, be it skeletal movement, speech control, emotion regulation
    etc. In humans, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for reasoning."
