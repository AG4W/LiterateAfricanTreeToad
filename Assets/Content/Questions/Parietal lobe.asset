  description: "\u2022    Located above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal
    lobe in each hemisphere.\r\n\u2022    Is partially responsible for sensory information
    like eye-to-hand coordination, spatial awareness and navigation\r\n\u2022   
    The front part of the parietal lobe processes sensory information while the rear
    area is specialized in integrating sensory sensations from the various sensory
    systems, mainly from the sense of touch and sight, but also to a lesser extent
    from other senses"
