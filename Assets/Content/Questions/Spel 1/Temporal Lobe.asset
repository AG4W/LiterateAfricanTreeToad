    is located beneath the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe. \n\nThe lobe is also
    involved in the processing of sensory input and is largely responsible for creating
    and perserving both consious and long-term memory.\r\n\nAnother of its important
    task is to handle both visual and sound processing that is crucial for both language
    recognition and object recognition."
